# Neural_Network_with_NumPy
*Neural network implementation using NumPy to identify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset).*

Two layer artificial neural network using mini-batch gradient descent for the classification of the MNIST dataset. 
It reaches 97% accuracy on the test set after 100 epochs with a mini-batch size of 1024. This training takes less than 160 seconds.
